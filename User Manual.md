How to run the pipeline
=======================

To run the pipeline, we advise using Microsoft Planetary Computer Hub as the main platform as this pipeline was develop in it therefore providing the best compatibility. However, running on a local machine is allowed as well but may be unstable. The dependencies can be installed on any device capable of running Python -- since the pipeline is a Jupyter notebook -- it is advisable to use a device optimized for data processing for best results.

The accepted start and end date formats are [dd mm YYYY, YYYY mm dd, dd/mm/YYYY, YYYY/mm/dd, dd-mm-YYYY, YYYY-mm-dd].
